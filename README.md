# I'm Daniel Zapata

I've been programming since I was a kid, and I'm always trying to learn how to do it better by starting some new project.

I've been in startups for the last 12 years and as a result the list of technologies I've used is long, but most recently I've been interested in Rust and Zig.

I'm currently available for hire on either a full-time or contract basis.
